        <h1>Why Trust This QMS</h1>
        <h2>A Registrar’s Perspective on ISO 9001</h2>
        <p>My name is <strong>Conal Puchalski</strong>, and I spent 15 years working for an ISO certification body (registrar)—not as a consultant, and not as an internal quality manager, but on the certification side of the table. I began my ISO career in 2009 after obtaining my auditor certification and progressed through the registrar qualification process: auditing as an observer, being observed and coached, conducting independent audits and ultimately serving as a lead auditor on ISO 9001 certification audits.</p>
        <p>Over the course of my career I:</p>
        <ul style="text-align:left; display:inline-block;">
          <li>Led ISO 9001 certification audits</li>
          <li>Was audited multiple times by ANAB as a lead auditor</li>
          <li>Served on the certification decision board, where final certification decisions were made</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I didn’t just audit quality systems—I participated in deciding whether organisations were granted ISO 9001 certification.</p>
        <h2>Experience at the Accreditation Level</h2>
        <p>When ISO 9001 transitioned to the 2015 revision, I authored the registrar’s internal audit program used to evaluate ISO 9001:2015 compliance at the certification‑body level. That system was reviewed annually during ANAB office audits, subjecting it to the same scrutiny applied to registrars themselves.</p>
        <p>My experience spans:</p>
        <ul style="text-align:left; display:inline-block;">
          <li>Audited organisations</li>
          <li>Certification body operations</li>
          <li>Accreditation oversight expectations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Very few ISO professionals have worked across all three.</p>
        <h2>Why I Built This System</h2>
        <p>After years of auditing organisations of all sizes and industries, one pattern became clear: most companies don’t struggle with ISO 9001 because they don’t care about quality. They struggle because their systems are:</p>
        <ul style="text-align:left; display:inline-block;">
          <li>over‑documented</li>
          <li>poorly structured</li>
          <li>clause‑driven instead of process‑driven</li>
          <li>created by people who have never approved a certification decision</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I built this QMS framework to reflect how ISO 9001 is actually evaluated, not how it is often marketed.</p>
        <h2>What This Is — and What It Isn’t</h2>
        <p><strong>This system is:</strong></p>
        <ul style="text-align:left; display:inline-block;">
          <li>registrar‑informed</li>
          <li>defensible under audit</li>
          <li>designed for real businesses</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>This system is not:</strong></p>
        <ul style="text-align:left; display:inline-block;">
          <li>a certification guarantee</li>
          <li>a shortcut</li>
          <li>a consulting or auditing service</li>
        </ul>
